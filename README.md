# Maze-Game
Created a maze game where the user navigates with the arrow keys, through a randomly generated maze, only being able to see a 1 block radius around him. The goal is to find all of the tokens before the monster(a randomly moving piece) finds you. Created from scratch for a school project.
More info about the details of how we were to code this can be found the file called 'Program3.pdf' and 'cpe102 - Project4.webarchive'.
